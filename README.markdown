tilewriter - README
===================

This is a (very simple) library that draws pictures (and text) formed by "tiles" using block elements (instead of, say, drawing over an HTML5 canvas). It was written mostly as a visual test, but may be useful for generating this kind of illustration dynamically on older browsers.

Usage
-----

It depends on jQuery, so you would include with code like this:

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="http://chester.me/tilewriter/tilewriter-0.2-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
Add a container for the drawing, such as:

    <div id="div_mario"></div>

And use it this way:

    tilewriter.reset();
    tilewriter.spacing = 0;
    tilewriter.size = 8;
    tilewriter.colors = ["", "#EA590C", "#AC7C00", "#FFA440"];
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "   111111    ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "  1111111111 ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "  22233233   ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", " 23233323333 ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", " 232233323333");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", " 22333322222 ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "   33333333  ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "  2232222    ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", " 22212212222 ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "2222111122222");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "3321311312333");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "3331111113333");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "3311111111333");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "  1111 1111  ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", " 2222   2222 ");
    tilewriter.drawRow("#div_mario", "22222   22222");

This will create a drawing like the one below:

All parameters are optional - try varying the spacing for a more "8-bit" look. You can also write text (the library has a built-in font borrowed from the ZX Spectrum, thanks to http://homepage.ntlworld.com/wholehog/stuart/fonts/index.html):

    tilewriter.drawText("#div_teste_2","Hello, world!");
